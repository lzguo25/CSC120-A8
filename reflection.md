Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


- Our class is a Pet Shelter! The Pet Shelter contains and interacts with pets that can fly, walk, grab, and even play with things. The PetShelter contains a Hashtable that prints out a registry of pets within the shelter. The shelter registry grows and shrinks based on how many pets have been adopted and how many are still living in the shelter.

- We added the addition play() and printRegistry() methods. The play method allows the pet to interact with a toy and impacts their health/energy level. The printRegistry() prints out the registry of pets at the shelter.

- I think that talking with peers will be very helpful, but constant communication and equal workload is necessary. While my teammates came up with the concept, not all of them were able to work on the assignment an equal amount, so I implemented almost every method from Contract, which made it feel like I did a lot more work than required. By the time that we met up again, there was some confusion on what our code was trying to achieve. Talking with someone can definitely help you understand the assignment better, and also come up with new ideas! Just make sure to keep up a strong line of communication so there isn't any frustration or confusion.
